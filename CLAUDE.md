# はなそう (Hanasou) — Project Bible

Read this before touching anything. It applies to any AI agent or human working
on this repo. It encodes decisions already made with the owner — don't relitigate
them, extend them.

## What this is

A kawaii-themed Japanese speaking PWA for one learner (the owner), built around
**speaking out loud**: English prompt → say it in Japanese → reveal, hear the
model answer, self-grade into a light SRS. Static site, no build step, no
framework — plain HTML/CSS/JS served from GitHub Pages, installable, works
fully offline.

**The product's soul:** a cozy Japanese shop-street. Warm, hand-drawn, playful —
never corporate, never noisy. Learning is the point; charm is the vehicle.

## Non-negotiable principles

1. **Speaking first.** Every feature should push the learner to produce Japanese
   out loud. Reading/tapping is support, not the goal.
2. **Fun, not gamified.** Rewards are *meaning made visible* (stamps for places
   visited, a street that comes alive), never points-for-points' sake. No XP,
   no leaderboards, no lives, no countdown timers, no artificial scarcity.
   Celebrations are rare enough to stay special.
3. **Japanese accuracy over convenience.** Grammar function-words (です, ます,
   から, ください, まで, とき…) are taught as grammar points, NOT added to vocab
   lists. Any word *named in a lesson's description* must actually appear in its
   taught vocab. Sentences follow the lesson's single grammar point.
4. **Quiet UI.** One idea per screen. Condense, nest, remove. The owner has
   repeatedly asked for fewer labels, fewer bars, tighter spacing. When in
   doubt, remove the element.
5. **Nothing breaks.** The app is live and used daily. Deploys must never leave
   the site broken or silent (see the audio re-voice procedure below).

## Architecture (all vanilla, no build)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | All screens as `<section class="screen">`, shown/hidden by `app.js` |
| `app.js` | Core logic: cards, SRS, drill, build mode, speaking quiz, mining, reader, sync. One IIFE; init runs at the bottom (`renderHome()`), so declaration order matters |
| `lessons.js` | ALL content: `window.LEVELS` (levels→tiers→themes) + `window.LESSONS` (vocab + sentences with word breakdowns) + `window.VERBS` |
| `theme.js` | Additive kawaii layer: header banner + control bar (moves `#back-btn`, `#card-counter`, `#mastery`, `#topbar-right` into `#ctrl-bar`), confetti/jingle FX (`window.HanaFX`), MP3 reward sounds with synth fallback. Uses MutationObservers on screen `[hidden]` attrs — it never patches app.js functions |
| `theme.css` | The entire visual theme, layered over `styles.css` base. `styles.css` is the old plain look; prefer overriding in `theme.css` |
| `collection.js` | Self-contained sticker/stamp add-on; listens to the `hanasou:finish` CustomEvent |
| `sw.js` | Service worker: `CACHE = "hanasou-vNN"`, precaches shell + all audio, network-first for navigations & `audio/manifest.json`, SWR for the rest |
| `tools/gen_audio.mjs` | Build-time VOICEVOX synthesis (see Audio) |
| `mock/` | A copy of the theme for design preview; `mock/theme.css` is GENERATED from `theme.css` (see deploy ritual) |

State: everything in `localStorage` (`hanasou.v4` progress, `hanasou.settings`),
optional token-based blob sync to a VPS at `/api/progress` with field-level merge.

## The deploy ritual (do all of it, every visual/JS change)

1. Edit `theme.css` / `app.js` / etc.
2. `node --check app.js` (and any other JS you touched).
3. Sync the mock: `sed 's#url("assets/#url("../assets/#g' theme.css > mock/theme.css`
4. Bump the version **everywhere it appears**: `?v=NN` in `index.html` (6 places)
   and `hanasou-vNN` in `sw.js`. They move together.
5. Commit with a plain, descriptive message. Push to the working branch AND the
   deploy branch (see Branches).

Skipping the bump means users keep the stale cached version. Skipping the mock
sync makes the design preview drift.

## Branches & hosting

- **`main`** is canonical (site + CI). GitHub Pages serves it; the repo is
  private (owner has Pro).
- Legacy branches `claude/*` are being retired; `claude/amazing-cannon-PPvmw`
  was the old Pages/deploy branch. Don't create new long-lived branches.
- The "art assets" commits on `claude/inspiring-carson-712EI` are CORRUPTED
  (binaries pushed through a text pipeline — every high byte is EF BF BD, same
  pixel dimensions as current art). Verified 2026-07-02: nothing mergeable;
  the branch is safe to delete.
- Live URL: https://pimpcats.github.io/japaneselanguage/
- The GitHub MCP/API in cloud sessions can't delete branches or change repo
  settings — those are owner dashboard actions. Say so instead of retrying.

## Audio (the part that's easiest to break)

Pipeline: `lessons.js` strings → `tools/gen_audio.mjs` → VOICEVOX engine →
`audio/<sha1-of-text>.mp3` + `audio/manifest.json` → `speak()` in app.js plays
the clip, falling back to device `speechSynthesis` if missing.

- **Voice:** もち子さん, VOICEVOX speaker **20** (set in `gen-audio.yml` and the
  script default). The owner picks the voice — never change it unprompted.
- **Clip filenames hash the TEXT ONLY.** Changing the voice does NOT regenerate
  clips — you must delete `audio/*.mp3` first, or the old voice is silently
  reused. This is the #1 trap.
- CI (`.github/workflows/gen-audio.yml`) runs on pushes to `main` touching
  `lessons.js` / the tool / the workflow: spins up VOICEVOX in Docker,
  synthesizes only missing clips, auto-bumps `sw.js`, commits with `[skip ci]`.
  A full re-voice of ~1,470 clips takes ~30–45 min.
- **Re-voice procedure (zero-downtime):** change speaker + delete clips on a
  branch the live site is NOT serving, let CI regenerate there, only then point
  the site at it. Never leave the live branch with deleted clips.
- Every tappable word chip has its own clip so taps never fall back to the
  robotic device voice. New sentences must come with `words:[]` breakdowns.
- English is NEVER spoken aloud. Japanese audio only.

## Content rules (lessons.js)

- Shape: `{ id, section, title, grammar, grammarNote, vocab:[{jp,romaji,en,pos}],
  sentences:[{en, jp, romaji, hint?, words:[{jp,en,pos}]}] }`. A lesson teaches
  ONE grammar point; sentences recombine its vocab.
- Sentence `jp` is kana-first (spaces between phrases). Kanji only with
  `kanji[reading]` furigana brackets.
- Every content word used in sentences should exist in some lesson's vocab
  (orphan check), and every word the grammarNote names must be taught. Grammar
  glue (です/ます/particles) stays out of vocab — it's taught by the note.
- `pos` values: n, v, adj, adv, prt, cop, expr, aux, conj — they drive the
  colour-coding; get them right.
- Adding/renaming lessons: `section` must match a theme listed in some level's
  `tiers[].themes`, or the lesson is invisible.

## Visual language (hard-won — do not rediscover these by trial and error)

- Ink-outlined "pop" style: `border: 2.5–3px solid var(--ink)` + hard drop
  shadow `0 3–4px 0 var(--ink)`; press = translateY + shadow collapse. ALL
  interactive elements get this treatment, including header icon buttons.
- The drill card frame is a `border-image` 9-slice (`assets/frame.png`). The
  cream fill must be `background-color` + `background-clip: padding-box` on the
  card itself — NOT a `::before` layer (negative z-index children paint OVER
  border-image; padding-box is what keeps fill inside the frame, no bleed).
- The header is one painted sign (`assets/sign.png` stretched over
  `#app-header`): title text in the top band, striped awning divider, controls
  (back/home · progress/mastery · gear) inside the lower band. It is NOT sticky —
  it scrolls with the page. Everything must fit inside the sign's white area.
- The gear is a toggle: opens Settings, tapping again returns to the exact
  previous screen. Collection 📖 lives on Home only.
- Preload any new hero asset in `index.html` (`<link rel="preload">`) and add it
  to the SW SHELL list — assets visibly popping in reads cheap.
- Muted text must stay readable: `--muted` is intentionally dark (#6b5847);
  don't lighten text on the translucent street background.
- Reward sounds are real MP3s (`assets/sfx-correct.mp3`,
  `assets/sfx-lesson-complete.mp3`) with a synth fallback in theme.js. Don't
  replace them with pure synthesis — it was tried and sounded cheap.

## Speaking quiz (app.js)

English prompt → Web Speech API (`ja-JP`) transcription → compare by READING:
both sides reduced to bare hiragana (kanji read via the vendored kuromoji
tokenizer, digits spelled out to kana — 500円→ごひゃくえん), scored by edit
distance. Thresholds: ≥75% pass, ≥50% close — deliberately forgiving, the
recognizer mishears a mora or two even on clean speech. Quiz is
pure practice — it must NEVER touch SRS scheduling (owner decision).
Speech recognition needs real Safari/Chrome (not webviews); the quiz degrades
to reveal-and-listen when unavailable.

## Working with the owner

- Ship small and iterate from screenshots; they test on an iPhone (Safari PWA)
  and reply with photos. Expect "a bit more / too high / bleed" refinement
  loops — that's the workflow, not scope creep.
- Report honestly: if you couldn't visually verify (no browser in the sandbox),
  say so and ask for a screenshot.
- Big changes to live behaviour (SRS, deploy targets, voice): confirm first.
  Styling/layout polish: just do it and deploy.
- The owner's stack outside this repo: GitHub Pages + a local VOICEVOX for
  auditioning voices. Keep everything runnable without Node build tooling.

## The character & journey layer (owner-approved direction)

- **もち子さん is a character, not just a voice**: she greets on lesson intros
  (`window.MOCHIKO.greetings`, bubble in `openIntro`), asks the quiz prompts,
  praises perfect spoken answers, and stars in **conversation scenes**
  (`window.SCENES` — her lines play aloud, your lines run the quiz mic flow).
  New scene lines for her need clips; reuse existing lesson sentences for the
  learner's lines so their clips already exist. Scenes so far: shop, café,
  introductions, station.
- **Listening mode** (`startQuiz(L, {listen:true})`, 👂 on lesson intros): no
  text shown — she speaks the sentence, the learner says it back, the reveal
  shows the meaning. Same mic flow and scoring as the speaking quiz.
- **The Japan-map journey** is the level page: cartoon-Japan SVG + pins, themes
  as regions, lessons as road nodes (label sits directly UNDER its dot — never
  beside, it misreads). "Ahead" nodes are styling only — every lesson stays
  tappable (no artificial scarcity, ever).
- **Planned: Donkey-Kong-style map** — nodes hopping between scenic spots on
  illustrated terrain. The OWNER is producing the art to `docs/ART_ROADMAP.md`
  (19 location panels, one per theme, spec + paint-briefs inside; panels land
  in `assets/map/`). Keep the node/trail DOM structure stable so panels can
  slot in behind it. Don't generate placeholder scenery art unprompted.
- **Real-world missions** (`window.MISSIONS`, shown on lesson complete) and the
  **weekly rhythm dots** (7 forgiving days, `prog.practice`) replace
  streak-guilt. Do not add streak pressure back.
- Rewards-as-content (unlockable voice styles / scenes) is the approved future
  direction for rewards — never points or XP.

## Known debt / open items (keep this list honest)

- The three 〜ざるを得ない sentences contain the kanji 得 without furigana.
- `resetProgress` says "erase all progress" but keeps mined/immersion/known.
- Speech recognition is unavailable in the installed iOS home-screen app
  (WebKit limitation) — the quiz explains this and degrades gracefully.
- Legacy `claude/*` branches await owner deletion; higher-res art sits unmerged
  on `claude/inspiring-carson-712EI` (owner hasn't decided).
- `_headers` is Cloudflare-only (harmless on Pages).
- No automated checks: at minimum `node --check` + a lessons linter (orphan
  vocab, described-but-untaught words, pos validity) should run in CI.
